# Greedy Problems Paradigm.

## What is greedy?
It is the problem solving paradigm where we make the locally optimal choice, and hope for the best outcome.
Sometimes it works efficiently and is  short. For many others it is however not.

We know that this preoblem can be solved by greedy if: 
- It has optimal  sub-structure:\ Optimal Solution to a problem consists of optimal sub problems.\
- It has the 'Greedy Property.':\ If we make a choice that seems like the best ast the moment and proceed to solve 
the remaining sub-problem we reach an optimal and never have to reconsider previous choice.
