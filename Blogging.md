- My Manda Kausthubh.

## What is this ?
This is my blog to document my journey in Competitive Programming. I have finally decided to take competitive Programming
more seriosly and hence this blog and repository. This is to primarily to enjoy the thrill of documentation and to introduce
accountability. <22nd October 2023>

## Blog of 22nd October
Hello there. Today I have participated in two contests Round 904 and Round 905. I have also started reading about Greedy approach to algorithms (Although very little). My rating today is 904 on Codeforces. In this contest I have solved only one problem each successfully.\ This is going to be a very long journey.
