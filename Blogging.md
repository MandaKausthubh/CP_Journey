## What is this ?
This is my blog to document my journey in Competitive Programming. I have finally decided to take competitive Programming
more seriosly and hence this blog and repository. This is to primarily to enjoy the thrill of documentation and to introduce
accountability. <22nd October 2023>\

### Entry of 22nd October
Hello there. Today I have participated in two contests Round 904 and Round 905. I have also started reading about Greedy approach to algorithms (Although very little). My rating today is 904 on Codeforces. In this contest I have solved only one problem each successfully.\
This is going to be a very long journey.\


## Entry of 23 October
Todays aim is to be able to read the tutorials and solve the remaining problems in yesterdays contests.
But before that I intend to read more on Greedy Algorithms.\
\
Mid Day update - I was able to solve a couple of problems but not really challenging as such. I have
however wasted a lot of time on youtube. I have started again by reading a couple of tutorials. I also
intend on doing more of my regular academics aand might take a break in the middle for that.\
\
End of the day:- Wasted alot of time on youtube have done literally NOTHING. I need to do better.
However I have to keep my self busy, because without being busy I have a habit of Over-Eating.\
